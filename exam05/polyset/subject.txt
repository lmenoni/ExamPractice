Assignment name: polyset
 Expected files : searchable array bag.cpp, searchable array bag.hpp.
 searchable tree bag.cpp, searchable_tree_bag.hpp, set.cpp, set.hpp

 In this directory, you will find various classes:
in  bag: an abstract class representing a bag.
searchable bag: an abstract class representing a bag with the ability to search within it.
 array bag: an implementation of a bag using an array as the underlying data structure.
 tree bag: an implementation of a bag using a binary search tree as the underlying data structure.


If you don't know what a set or a bag is, you can read the attached file:
sets and bags.en.txt (wikipedia, sostanzialmente una bag senza duplicati)
#### First part #

Since a bag without a searching function is not very useful, implement two
classes, searchable array bag and searchable tree bag, that will inherit from 20 array bag and tree bag, respectively, and implement the searchable bag abstract
class.

#### Second part #

Implement the class set that will wrap searchable bag and turn it into a set.
In this directory, you will find a main file that must compile with your code.
All your classes should follow the orthodox canonical form.
Don't forget the consts.
The optimization of your code is not important in this exercise.
