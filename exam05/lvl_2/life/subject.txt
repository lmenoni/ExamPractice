Assignment name : life

Expected files : *.c *.h
Allowed functions: atoi, read, putchar, malloc, calloc, realloc, free

You must write a program that simulates a game of life.
The prototype of this program is the following:
./life width height iterations

Width and height are the dimensions of the board and iterations is the number of iterations of the game of life.
The initial configuration of the board is drawn by a sequence of commands
in the standard input.

Imagine a pen starting in the top left corner of the board.
Each command is one of these characters:
'w', 'a', 's', 'd': move the pen up, left, down, and right.
'x': lift or lower the pen in order to start or stop drawing. Default is: pen not drawin

Your pen does not move outside of the board and stays still if a command asks for it. Your pen does nothing in case of an invalid command.

Once the end of the file is reached, your program must simulate a game of life on this board and print the result to stdout (each living cell is represented by the character '0' and each dead cell by a space).

each cell outside of the array will be considered dead.

Examples:

$> echo 'sdxddssaaww' | ./a.out 5 5 0 | cat -e
     $

$> echo 'sdxssdswdxdddxsaddawxwdxwaa' | ./a.out 10 6 0 | cat -e
